Hardware Requirements
---------------------

Please see the [Hardware Compatibility List](/doc/HCL) page for more information on required and recommended hardware.

Note: We don't recommend installing Qubes in a virtual machine! It will likely not work. Don't send emails asking about it. However, you can install it on an external USB hard drive and run from it, at least for testing (normally such disks are *orders* of magnitude slower than even the slowest internal hard drives).

Download installer ISO
----------------------

See [this page](/doc/QubesDownloads) for ISO downloads. Remember, we have absolutely no control over those servers, and so you should be assuming that they might be compromised, or just be serving a compromised ISOs because their operators decided so, for whatever reason. Always verify the digital signature on the downloaded ISO. See this [page](/doc/VerifyingSignatures) for more info about how to download and verify our GPG keys, and then verify the downloaded ISO:

{% highlight trac-wiki %}
gpg -v <iso>.asc
{% endhighlight %}

Burning the ISO onto a DVD or USB stick
---------------------------------------

Once you verify this is an authentic ISO, you should burn it on a DVD.

If you prefer to use USB as a source for installation, then you just need to copy the ISO onto the USB device, e.g. using dd:

{% highlight trac-wiki %}
dd if=Qubes-R2-Beta3-x86_64-DVD.iso of=/dev/sdX
{% endhighlight %}

On windows you can use [this](http://www.chrysocome.net/dd) tool. Example command would be (as Administrator):

{% highlight trac-wiki %}
dd if=Qubes-R2-Beta3-x86_64-DVD.iso of=\\?\Device\Harddisk1\Partition0 bs=1M --size --progress
{% endhighlight %}

**Be sure to use a correct device as the target in the dd command above (instead of sdX or Harddisk1)**

Before proceeding with the installation, you are encouraged to first read all the information on this page, especially the *Known Issues* paragraph.

Then, when finally ready, boot your system from the installer DVD and follow the instructions on screen. The installer is very simple and asks very few questions -- it's actually easier to install Qubes right now than most other Linux distributions!

The installer loads Xen right at the beginning, so chances are high that if you can see the installer's graphical screen, Qubes will work on your system :)

Upgrading from Qubes R1 or R2 Beta 2
------------------------------------

The easiest and safest way to upgrade to Qubes R2B3 is to install it from scratch and use [qubes backup and restore tools](/doc/BackupRestore) for migrating of all of the user VMs.

Users can also try a manual upgrade procedure that has been described [here](/doc/UpgradeToR2B3).

Note: if the user has custom Template VMs (i.e. other than the default template, e.g. created from it by cloning), or Standalone VMs, then the user should perform manual upgrade from R2B2 to R2B3, as described under the link given above.

Installing Updates
------------------

NOTE: Updates has been released after R2B3 ISO has been built -- it is recommended to install Dom0 updates shortly after installation to resolve some of the issues mentioned in the section below (Known Issues).

Installing updates is very easy and can be done using the "Update" button in the Qubes Manager. Alternatively it can also be done from command prompt -- see the following for more details:

-   For installing updates for Dom0 -- see instructions [here](/doc/SoftwareUpdateDom0).
-   For installing updates for you domains (VMs) -- see instructions [here](/doc/SoftwareUpdateVM).

Troubleshooting problems with the installer
-------------------------------------------

If the installer fails for some reason, typically because of the graphics card not being correctly supported, it is possible to try booting the installer with a different kernel -- to do that, choose Troubleshooting menu in the Installer Welcome screen, and later choose an option to proceed with one of the kernels provided:

![r2b3-installer-troubleshooting.png](/attachment/wiki/InstallationGuideR2B3/r2b3-installer-troubleshooting.png)

The installer ships with 3 different kernels (3.11, 3.9 and 3.7) and all those kernel will be installed (regardless of which is selected to run the installer) so it is later always possible to boot the Qubes OS using any of those kernels.

Known Issues
------------

-   On some graphics cards the Xfce4 Window Manager (one of the two supported Dom0 Windows Managers in Qubes R2 B2, the other being KDE) might behave "strangely", e.g. decorations might not be drawn sometimes. Also the accompanying lightdm login manager might incorrectly display the wallpaper. If you're facing those problems, it's advisable to use the KDE Window Manager and kdm instead of Xfce4 and lightdm (this is default if one chooses the KDE only installation option in the installer).

-   Some icons in the Qubes Manager application might not be drawn correctly when using the Xfce4 environment in Dom0. If this bothers you, please use the KDE environment instead.

-   When restoring service VMs from a backup (such as custom netvms, firewallvms, etc) their icons might not be preserved in the "Start Menu".

-   If you're GPU is not correctly supported by the Dom0 kernel (e.g. the 3D desktop effects do not run smoothly) then you might experience "heaviness" with Windows 7-based AppVMs. In that case, please solve the problem with your GPU support in Dom0 in the first place (by using a different kernel), or install Qubes OS on a different system.

-   For HVMs without Qubes Tools installed the GUI window will not be shown unless 'debug' flag is enabled for the VM. This has been fixed in `qubes-core-dom0` package \>= 2.1.35 -- please ensure you install updates after installation to resolve this issue.

-   Clocks might not get syncs in the VMs for up to several minutes after resume from sleep. This has been fixed in `qubes-core-dom0-linux` package \>= 2.0.4 -- please ensure you install updates after installation to resolve this issue.

-   Gnome terminal window sometimes shrinks to minimal size (especially when opening new tab). The workaround is to disable its menubar and scrollbar.

Getting Help
------------

-   **User manuals are [here](/doc/UserDoc).** (Strongly recommended!)

-   Developers documentation (normally not needed by users) is [here](/doc/SystemDoc)

-   If you don't find answer in the sources given above, write to the *qubes-users* mailing list (you don't need to be subscribed to the list, just send email to the address given below):
