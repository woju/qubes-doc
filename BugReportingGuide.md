Bug Reporting Guide
===================

One of the most important contribution task is reporting the bugs you have found.

All bugs and suggestions should be reported to one of our [mailing list](/doc/QubesLists). We decided that at this stage access to the wiki and the [ticketing system](/report/3) should be limited and per-invitation only, and generally granted to those people who actually can first demonstrate that they are capable of contributing something useful to the project. Our main goal is to build a quality product, and this has a priority over building "a large community".

So if you have not allowed to file new tickets You should follow these guide lines:

1.  Search the issue tracker to see if your issue is already there - if so please cite the issue \# in any comments you post.
    -   [Simple search](/search)
    -   [Advanced search](https://wiki.qubes-os.org/query?status=accepted&status=assigned&status=new&status=reopened&order=priority)

1.  Search the [mailing lists](/doc/QubesLists) to see if your issue is already discussed - if so, add your comments to the existing thread.

1.  If your problem seems to be a new one, report it:
    -   as a mail, with a clear specific subject like "bug report: \<specific description\>"
    -   include steps to reproduce the problem if possible, and relevant log files (if you know)
    -   if its a hardware related issue include your [HCL](/doc/HCL) Support files as well.

1.  Qubes [developers](/doc/QubesDevelopers) may ask you additional questions - please do follow up.

1.  If the issue can be validated as a definite bug then they enters it into the [issue tracker](/report/3).
